# Time-Compelxity

 Examples of the time complexity of algorithms. The time complexity of
 algorithms is measured by the number of times statements are being
 executed in the algorithm, not by the time the algorithm takes to end
 the execution.
  
 Big O notation is used to describe the time complexity of an
 algorithm. it describes the relationship between "n", the input into
 the algorithm, and the number of executions of statements in that
 algorithm. an algorithm might consist of one or more statements.
